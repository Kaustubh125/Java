#History of Java

Java was originally created in 1992 by James Gosling, Herbert Schildt, Patrick Naughton, and Mike Sheridan, initially known as the Oak programming language. However, Oak failed to gain traction, leading to the development and release of Java 1.0 in 1995. Later that year, Java was acquired by Sun Microsystems, which then launched Java 2, marking a significant milestone in the language's evolution.

In 2000, Sun Microsystems expanded Java's reach by developing the J2ME platform for mobile devices. In 2009, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation, making Oracle the new steward of Java, a role it continues to hold today.
